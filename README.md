# Vietnam-air-pollution-data-analysis-with-SAS
The goal of the project is to clean and analyze the given datasets on PM2.5 pollutant concentrations in the city of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam over the given period, and develop both descriptive statistics and inferential analysis required to identify monthly or yearly trends for PM2.5 in Ho Chi Minh, before and after the COVID-19 lockdown period. Based on the outputs, we aim to provide recommendations from a well-being perspective to the residents.

Summary of work in this project:

Checked issues with the data quality such as out of range scores, outliers and fix them. Determined missing data patterns, performed imputation using suitable techniques.

Performed descriptive analysis of variables by producing line graphs, clustered bar graphs, scatter plots, box  plots, summary tables to study patterns of air pollution in Vietnam

Used SQL queries (PROC SQL command) in SAS to calculate a missing feature "now cast concentrate" with the PM 2.5 pollutant and subsequently calculated missing AQI values of the city.

Determined pearson and spearman correlation of the variables to determine highly correlated variables and strength of their correlation and their relationship with AQI

Based on the patterns observed in pollutant levels, AQI of the city, and inferences from the above analysis, we suggested recommendations to the people of HCMC city from a wellbeing perspective.
